# Networking Basics Project

This project covers fundamental networking concepts and practical tasks using Bash scripts. The focus is on understanding network configuration, IP addresses, and basic networking tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

### General Concepts
- **localhost/127.0.0.1**: What it is and its significance in networking.
- **0.0.0.0**: What it represents and how it differs from 127.0.0.1.
- **/etc/hosts**: The purpose of the hosts file and how to modify it.
- **Displaying active network interfaces**: How to use network tools to show your machineâ€™s network interfaces.

### Specific Tools and Commands
- **ifconfig**: Displaying and configuring network interfaces.
- **telnet**: Connecting to remote hosts over TCP/IP networks.
- **nc (Netcat)**: A versatile networking tool for debugging and testing.
- **cut**: A command to extract sections from each line of files.
